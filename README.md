# Inventory Manager

I developed a **web-based Inventory Management System** using **Flask** as the backend framework, **SQLite** as the database, and **Bootstrap** for a clean and responsive UI.  
Business track products, store them in different locations, record stock movements, and see the current stock levels at each place
The project was designed to demonstrate **full-stack development skills** with a focus on **data modeling, CRUD operations, and real-time reporting**.
